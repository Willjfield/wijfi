        "description": "The Long Island Zoning Atlas is an interactive web map that displays zoning data, public services, and demographic data for municipalities all across Long Island excluding New York City. The project presented a problem very common to GIS projects: transforming data from many different sources, in this cases towns. We were given the data in many different formats and needed to transform it all into clean, usable data which is organized to our needs and renders quickly and efficiently on the web.",

        "description": "Redistricting is often a complex and complicated process. Given the often rushed nature of redistricting it was crucial to provide fair district advocates, journalists, and lawmakers with accurate maps and data as soon as proposed districts became publicly available. In previous projects, we relied on a mostly proprietary back-end. In 2021, we implemented a new back-end stack to connect our spatial databases to our web sites using FOSS solutions: QGIS, PostGres with PostGIS, Mapbox, and Nodejs. The result is a free, fully customizable solution that is easy to update, maintain, and migrate. ",

Reports highlight trends and changes by geographic area and demographic data, response methods, and more."
